# Section 5: Machine Learning

Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

- Maintenance = High
- Number of doors = 4
- Lug Boot Size = Big
- Safety = High
- Class Value = Good

*Note: please also export and submit your notebook as pdf.*

# Comments

A notebook is provided which can train a model to predict the buying price.

This notebook will produce a model, which will work differently from a normal decision tree.

An explanation for this is provided in the notebook, with proper functions to run the predictions.
